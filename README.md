Uncomplited, backlogged Mega.nz JS library.

- `npm ci`
- `npm run build`

To open a web demo run a http server in the root folder, then open a html file from `_examples-browser` directory.

Or try to use a Node.js demo from `_examples-node` directory. (Note: remove `import * as URLS from "./test-urls-private.js";` first and use your own Mega URL.)
